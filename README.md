# Image-segmentation-and-Object-Detection


**Image Segmentation and Object Detection**: This project utilizes the PixelLib library for performing image segmentation and object detection. The model, `mask_rcnn_coco.h5`, is loaded to identify and segment objects within an image. The project demonstrates practical applications of computer vision techniques in detecting and localizing objects within images.
